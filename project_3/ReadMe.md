# Velocity Kinematics of RRR Robot

### Assignment:
1. By calculating Jacobian matrix, move the robot accordingly and update kinematic map. Print jacobian matrix and change in position.
2. Apply inverse velocity kinematics. Using v(t) and ω(t) values found with J(q(t)) for t = kδt for each k = 1, . . . , 600, try to find θ̇1 , θ̇2 , θ̇3.
